                  I am a scientist with several years of experience in data analysis, statistics,
                  machine learning, and software development. I have a PhD in Physics obtained in 2011,
                  four years of experience as a Postdoctoral researcher at CERN, three years
                  of experience working with startups in several roles, and a couple of years of experience
                  as a senior Data Scientist and a Data Scientist Team Lead.

                  Difficult challenges always motivate me, I use them to constantly expand the limits of my knowledge.
                  I like to approach problems with the global picture in mind, finding the best solutions after
                  considering several possible options. I am a self-starter and an explorer.
                  I like to take new ideas and identify their commercial or scientific potential.
                  I am self-motivated and resilient, and I like to motivate people around me.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I am always searching for new challenges where my contribution can make the difference.
                  I am motivated by purpose, and responsibility. The roles I enjoy fulfilling always include
                  the responsibility of taking decisions and helping people to obtain the best possible results.
